# Containerized Virtualized Sensor Management System (CVSMS)
Web application can be used to add or remove different environmental sensors and provide the end users with APIs to access the data.

## Tasks tackled
* Dynamically create containers representing sensors. 
* Use Docker containers to manage the web application.
* Simulating physical sensors on containers.

## Functionalities provided by web application
* Register users as sensor owners.
* Provide operations to add/remove sensors.
* Provide APIs to access the sensor data.
* Provide sensor application to make use of API exposed to visualize data.

## High level flow of application
* User registers with the web application.
* Adds a new environment sensor by specifying the type, location and other relevant information.
* A virtual sensor is created representing the physical sensor.
* Successful sensor addition will expose APIs for accessing the data.
